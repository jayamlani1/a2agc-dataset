## Visualization Creation

This visualization was created from the [csv file](assets/generated/vis-geomap-opioid-deaths.csv) using <a href="https://github.com/cns-iu/a2agc-dataset/tree/main/data-processor/src/create-vis-geomap-opioid-deaths-project.ts" target="_blank">this script</a>. The script creates a `Project` from the imported CSV file and sets up a geomap visualization (see below).

## Data and Graphic Variable Extraction

In addition to extracting raw data, the query also creates columns for data-variable to graphic-variable mappings as follows:

* Color mapping was created from the `SEX` column, if `SEX` was `male`, a value of `blue` was assigned and for `female`, a value of `pink` was assigned.
* Stroke Color mapping was created from the `HOME_STATE` column, if `HOME_STATE` was `IN`, a value of `#bebebe` was assigned, else `black` was assigned.
* Shape mapping was created from `HOME_STATE`, if `HOME_STATE` was `IN`, a value of `circle` as assigned, else `triangle` was assigned.
* Area Size mapping was created from `N_OPIOID_PRESCRIPTIONS` and results interpolated in the range of `25 - 525`.

The results were exported to a [csv file](assets/generated/vis-geomap-opioid-deaths.csv) and used to create the visualization.
