## Usage

Click and drag a region in the Date of Death vs # Deaths graph in order to filter the data by time interval. Use the mouse wheel in order to increase or decrease the length of the interval. You may also slide the selected interval left or right along the date axis. 

## Purpose and Details

The purpose of this visualization is to provide insight on the frequency of common events that commonly occur before an overdose death.

Four touchpoints are analyzed:

1. Opioid Prescription (Rx): Whether or not an individual had received an opioid prescription. This includes any opioid or benzo medications that were provided to the individual.
2. Overdose (OD): Whether or not an individual had a previous overdose requiring EMS intervention. 
3. Incarceration (Jail): Whether or not an individual had been in jail.
4. Health Data (Health): Whether or not an individual had a recent encounter with healthcare services (excluding opioid prescriptions).

The visualization provides a comparison of the number of cases across each possible combination of the above touchpoints, including the case where no touchpoints apply (∅).

2331 total overdose deaths from 2010-2018 were referenced across four separate datasets corresponding to each of the four touchpoints. The timeframes for each dataset are as follows:

1. Medications: 2010-2018 (based on date of death)
2. EMS Incidents: 2011-2018 (based on date of overdose incident)
3. Incarcerations: 2014-2018 (based on date of incarceration)
4. Health Encounters: 2010-2018 (based on date of death)

## Data and Graphic Variable Extraction

The table was created using the following SQL script:

The resulting aggregated data can be found [here](assets/generated/visualization2/data.csv).

Following rules were used to determined each of the following attributes:

1. Prescription VS No Prescription: True if any one of the flags OPIOD_FLAG or BENZO_FLAG was set in `medications` table for the particular CASE_NUMBER, False otherwise.
2. Overdose VS No Overdose: True if OVERDOSE_CC_MOI or NALOXONE_DUMMY was set in `ems_incidents` table for the particular CASE_NUMBER, False otherwise.
3. Justice Involvement VS No Involvement: If the particular CASE_NUMBER is present in `incarcerations` table then True, False otherwise.
4. Health Data VS No Health Data: True if CASE_NUMBER is present in `encounters` table, False otherwise.
